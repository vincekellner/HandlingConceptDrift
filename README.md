# HandlingConceptDrift
Strategies to detect and handle incremental concept drift in time series data

Based on the dataset of TLC in which various types of drift can be detected, different strategies are provided how to handle incremental drift.


## Definition of concept drift



## Adaptation strategies 


#### Blind adaptation strategies:

- Regular training of a new model

- Regular incremental training of a model

#### Informed adaptation strategies with drift detectors:

- Regular training of a new model triggered by a detection mechanism

- Regular incremental training of a model triggered by a detection mechanism

- Combination of incremental trainings & training of a new model triggered by a detection mechanism ("Switching Scheme")
